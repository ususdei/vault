Vault is a python interface to "pass", a simple shell script
to access a gpg-encrypted password store.

It shall provide a more convenient interface, more field semantics
and some init scripts to seed other programs like ssh-agent, kinit, netctl, ...

For now it has only been tested to work with:
arch linux
python 3.4.3
gpg 2.1.5

Use at your own risk.

For now, the sources are the docs.
